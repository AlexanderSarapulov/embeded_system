Embeded system labs.
Equipment: 
* PS/2 mouse;
* Arduino Uno board;
* MI0283QT2 Display.

How the project works.
Mouse schould be wired to Arduino board (see how to do it in Project scheme.jpg file).
In the beginning there are three buttons on the display. 
They are: - Distance;
	  - Circle sq;
	  - Rect sq.
One can press any of them. First one measures distance, that mouse went,
second - square of the sircle based on it diameter,
third - square of the rectangle based on lengths of it sides.

When left button of the mouse is pressed then pause moude is activated,
if right button - measured data reset.

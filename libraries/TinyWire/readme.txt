# Arduino TinyWire Library from [sudar](https://github.com/sudar/TinyWire)

TinyWire is an Arduino library, that provides I2C support for ATtiny micro controllers.

ATtiny micro controllers don't have built in support for I2C or SPI, instead they have only a Universal Serial Interface (USI). This library uses that to provide I2C support for ATtiny micro controllers.

## Installation

To install the library, download or checkout the source code and place it inside your Arduino's libraries folder.

Check out the examples inside the `/examples` directory to find out how to use the library.

## Credits

This library was originally written by [Bro Hogan](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/USIi2c) with contributions from [rambo](https://github.com/rambo/TinyWire) and [svoisen](https://github.com/svoisen/TinyWire)
